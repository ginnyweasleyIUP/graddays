Reconstruction, modeling and future implications of changes in past climate variability

Investigating past climate changes offers a unique key to understanding the future behavior of the Earth system under anthropogenic perturbation, because our past is the only true realization of the "Earth system experiment" we are part of. The nonstationary dynamics of the climate system evolve at the interplay between its topological, chemical, biological and thermodynamical boundary conditions and the external forcing that is exerted mainly by the sun. Yet, a closed description of the system's dynamics is impossible due to the large number of variables, continuously changing boundary conditions and nonlinear interdependencies which give rise to chaotic behavior. Climate modeling and paleoclimate reconstruction are therefore the two central means to improve the knowledge and understanding of past Earth system dynamics. They depend on each other: Paleoclimate data are the only witnesses that can yield knowledge on the state of the Earth system in the past; climate models solve fundamental equations for physical, chemical, and biological processes, against the background of solar forcing and global geography.
